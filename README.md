# Wtf
Below, under the People-Counting-in-Real-Time section, you'll find the technical details of the project. This section though is for my own thoughts on the project and what the next steps are.

## So what am I building?
I'm building a system, that given a video stream of an audience of people, detects the people's movements, the number of people, and a few other parameters, and adapts the music based on those parameters.

To begin with, I'll be using a video stream, and measuring to things:
* The BPM that the people are dancing to
* The number of people dancing

Then, I'll be using those two parameters to adapt the music.

## Why am I building this?
Cause why not?

Actually, it started with an idea that came to mind in Sadlers Wells. While sitting in the audience waiting for a show to start, the house lights were still on and we all waited patiently.
After a minute or so, I heard someone sneezing in the audience, and immediately thereafter the house lights turned off and the show began.
It was like a lightbulb moment - the connection between the audience and the show is two way - the audience affects the show just as much as the show affects the audience.

This project is one of the ways I'm exploring that connection.

## How am I building this?
Using OpenCV, and maybe Sardine, but one idea that came up is to use Soundcloud to do a BPM search, and then use the Soundcloud API to play the music. 

## Next steps
* [ ] Get a video stream of people dancing
* [ ] Get the BPM of the people dancing - ON HOLD
  * This is kind of working inside `people_counter.frequency_measurement`, though the bpm is very crude. We need:
  * [ ] A moving average of the last two minutes, to detect bpm over a large period of time
  * [ ] Variance of the last two minutes, to detect if the bpm is useful - if the variance is too high, then the bpm is not useful
* [ ] Get the number of people in the party
* [ ] Adapt the music based on the number of people - more people, more energy or louder music
* [ ] Dim lights based on the number of people - when we get to a certain number of people, dim the lights. Up until 20 people the lights should get brighter, and then dim after that.
* [ ] Integrate with Soundcloud and do a BPM search
* [ ] Play the music using the Soundcloud API

- The primary aim is to use the project as a business perspective, ready to scale.
- Use case: counting the number of people in the stores/buildings/shopping malls etc., in real-time.
- Sending an alert to the staff if the people are way over the limit.
- Automating features and optimising the real-time stream for better performance (with threading).
- Acts as a measure towards footfall analysis and in a way to tackle COVID-19 scenarios.

## Simple Theory

### SSD detector

- We are using a SSD ```Single Shot Detector``` with a MobileNet architecture. In general, it only takes a single shot to detect whatever is in an image. That is, one for generating region proposals, one for detecting the object of each proposal.
- Compared to other two shot detectors like R-CNN, SSD is quite fast.
- ```MobileNet```, as the name implies, is a DNN designed to run on resource constrained devices. For e.g., mobiles, ip cameras, scanners etc.
- Thus, SSD seasoned with a MobileNet should theoretically result in a faster, more efficient object detector.

### Centroid tracker

- Centroid tracker is one of the most reliable trackers out there.
- To be straightforward, the centroid tracker computes the ```centroid``` of the bounding boxes.
- That is, the bounding boxes are ```(x, y)``` co-ordinates of the objects in an image.
- Once the co-ordinates are obtained by our SSD, the tracker computes the centroid (center) of the box. In other words, the center of an object.
- Then an ```unique ID``` is assigned to every particular object deteced, for tracking over the sequence of frames.

## Running Inference

### Install the dependencies

First up, install all the required Python dependencies by running: ```
pip install -r requirements.txt ```

> NOTE: Supported Python version is 3.11.3 (there can always be version conflicts between the dependencies, OS, hardware etc.).

### Test video file

To run inference on a test video file, head into the root directory and run the command:

```
python people_counter.py --prototxt detector/MobileNetSSD_deploy.prototxt --model detector/MobileNetSSD_deploy.caffemodel --input utils/data/tests/test_1.mp4
```

### Webcam

To run on a webcam, set ```"url": 0``` in ```utils/config.json``` and run the command:

```
python people_counter.py --prototxt detector/MobileNetSSD_deploy.prototxt --model detector/MobileNetSSD_deploy.caffemodel
```

### IP camera

To run on an IP camera, setup your camera url in ```utils/config.json```, e.g., ```"url": 'http://191.138.0.100:8040/video'```.

Then run the command:
```
python people_counter.py --prototxt detector/MobileNetSSD_deploy.prototxt --model detector/MobileNetSSD_deploy.caffemodel
```

## Features

The following features can be easily enabled/disabled in ```utils/config.json```:

```json
{
    "Email_Send": "",
    "Email_Receive": "",
    "Email_Password": "",
    "url": "",
    "ALERT": false,
    "Threshold": 10,
    "Thread": false,
    "Log": false,
    "Scheduler": false,
    "Timer": false
}
```

### Real-Time alert

If selected, we send an email alert in real-time. Example use case: If the total number of people (say 10 or 30) are exceeded in a store/building, we simply alert the staff.

- You can set the max. people limit in config, e.g., ```"Threshold": 10```.
- This is quite useful considering scenarios similar to COVID-19. Below is an example:

> ***1. Setup your emails:***

In the config, setup your sender email ```"Email_Send": ""``` to send the alerts and your receiver email ```"Email_Receive": ""``` to receive the alerts.

> ***2. Setup your password:***

Similarly, setup the sender email password ```"Email_Password": ""```.

Note that the password varies if you have secured 2 step verification turned on, so refer the links below and create an application specific password:

- For 2 step verified accounts: https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833

### Threading

- Multi-Threading is implemented in ```utils/thread.py```. If you ever see a lag/delay in your real-time stream, consider using it.
- Threading removes ```OpenCV's internal buffer``` (which basically stores the new frames yet to be processed until your system processes the old frames) and thus reduces the lag/increases fps.
- If your system is not capable of simultaneously processing and outputting the result, you might see a delay in the stream. This is where threading comes into action.
- It is most suitable to get solid performance on complex real-time applications. To use threading: set ```"Thread": true,``` in config.

### Scheduler

- Automatic scheduler to start the software. Configure to run at every second, minute, day, or workdays e.g., Monday to Friday.
- This is extremely useful in a business scenario, for instance, you could run the people counter only at your desired time (maybe 9-5?).
- Variables and any cache/memory would be reset, thus, less load on your machine.

```python
# runs at every day (09:00 am)
schedule.every().day.at("9:00").do(run)
```

### Timer

- Configure stopping the software execution after a certain time, e.g., 30 min or 8 hours (currently set) from now.
- All you have to do is set your desired time and run the script.

```python
# automatic timer to stop the live stream (set to 8 hours/28800s)
end_time = time.time()
num_seconds = (end_time - start_time)
if num_seconds > 28800:
    break
```

### Simple log

- Logs the counting data at end of the day.
- Useful for footfall analysis. Below is an example:
